	6. Anonymous can be a horrible, senseless, uncaring monster
	7. Anonymous is still able to deliver
	B. There are no real rules about posting
	9. There are no real rules about moderation either - enjoy your ban
	10. If you enjoy any rival sites - DON'T
	11. All your carefully picked arguments can easily be ignored
	12. Anything you say can and will be used against you
	13. Anything you say can be turned into something else - fixed
	14. Do not argue with trolls - it means that they win
	15. The harder you try the harder you will fail
	16. If you fail in epic proportions, it may just become a winning failure
	17. Every win fails eventually
	13. Everything that can be labeled can be hated
	19. The more you hate it the stronger it gets
	20. Nothing is to be taken seriously
	21. Original content is original only for a few seconds before getting old
	22. Copypasta is made to ruin every last bit of originality
	23. Copypasta is made to ruin every last bit of originality
	24. Every repost is always a repost of a repost

	37. You can not divide by zero [just because the calculator says so]
	38. No real limits of any kind apply here - not even the sky
	39. CAPSLOCK IS CONTROLUISE CONTROL FOR COOL
	40. EVEN WITH CRUISE CONTROL YOU STILL HAVE TO STEER
	41. Desu isn't funny. Seriously guys. It's worse than Chuck Norris jokes.
	42. Nothing is Sacred
	43. The more beautiful and pure a thing is - the more satisfying it is to corrupt it
	44. Even one positive comment about Japanese things can make you a weeaboo
	45. Uhen one sees a lion, one must get into the car.
	46. There is always furry porn of it.
